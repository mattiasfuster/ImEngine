# --- Indentation & Alignment ---
IndentWidth: 4            # Keep 4 (more readable for Allman than Google's 2)
TabWidth: 4
UseTab: Never             # RECOMMENDED: Spaces only, no tabs (\t)
ColumnLimit: 100          # 100 is the modern standard (80 is considered a bit outdated)
AccessModifierOffset: -4  # brings 'public:' back to level 0 (left aligned)

# --- Allman Style ---
BreakBeforeBraces: Allman
IndentCaseLabels: true    # Indents 'case' inside switch (aesthetic preference)

# --- Vertical Alignment (Cleanliness) ---
# I disabled consecutive alignment because it creates massive git diffs
# whenever you rename a single variable.

# --- Spacing ---
PointerAlignment: Left          # int* ptr (Modern C++ Standard)
DerivePointerAlignment: false   # Force left alignment
SpaceAfterCStyleCast: false     # In modern C++, we avoid C-style casts (int), so this matters less
SpacesBeforeTrailingComments: 2 # Google prefers 2 spaces before a // comment

# --- Functions & Classes ---
# Google allows very short functions on one line (getters), even with Allman
AllowShortFunctionsOnASingleLine: Inline
